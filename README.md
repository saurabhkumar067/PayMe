TASK

I successfully completed the task of building a responsive web page using React.js and Tailwind CSS on time. I set up the React project and integrated Tailwind CSS for styling, organizing everything into modular components for different sections of the page. By leveraging Tailwindâ€™s utility classes, I was able to quickly adjust styles and maintain a modern, consistent look across all devices. I made sure the design was responsive and tested it across various browsers to ensure everything worked smoothly. The end result is a visually appealing and functional web page, highlighting my skills in both React and Tailwind CSS.
